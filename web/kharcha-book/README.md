# Kharcha Book

Daily expense tracker (static web app, no build step) backed by Supabase.

## Setup
1. In the Supabase SQL editor, run `../../supabase/daily_expenses.sql` (creates only `daily_expenses`, with RLS).
2. `config.js` is committed with the project URL and the public anon key (safe to expose; RLS protects the data). To use another project, edit it or start from `config.example.js`.
3. Serve this folder with any static server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8080`, and open it on your phone or desktop.
   Sign-in only: create your user in Supabase (Authentication > Users > Add user) and turn off new sign-ups (Authentication > Sign In / Providers).

4. Run `../../supabase/daily_expenses_v2_sms.sql` once as well. It adds `ref_no` and `raw_sms`, so the same bank SMS can never be added twice. The app still works before this runs, but then it can only warn about "same amount, same day".

## Bank SMS parsing
**Parse Bank SMS** (or sharing an SMS to the app, or copying one before opening it) only adds money that actually left your account. These are rejected with a reason: failed or declined payments, refunds and reversals, cashback, money received, payment requests, bill / autopay reminders, credit card bill payments and transfers between your own accounts, OTPs, offers, and scam messages (KYC, "account blocked").

The preview shows the bank, account, reference number and a confidence label. You can fix the amount, description and date before adding. The date comes from the SMS, not the time you paste it. If you change a merchant's description, the next SMS from that merchant uses your version (saved on this device).

Run the tests with `node test-kharcha.js`. Add any SMS that gets misread to that file.

## Install on a phone
Open the page in Chrome (Android) and tap the menu > **Add to Home screen** / **Install app**. On iPhone use Safari > Share > **Add to Home Screen**.

## Fingerprint / PIN lock
After signing in, tap **Turn on fingerprint / PIN lock**. The app then asks for the phone's fingerprint, face, PIN or pattern when it opens and after it has been in the background for a minute.
This is a lock on the device. The sign-in session stays in the browser, so it keeps casual users out but is not server-side verification. Needs HTTPS (GitHub Pages is) and a phone screen lock.

## Email code sign-in
The page signs in with a one-time email code (existing users only; it never creates accounts). A password option remains as a fallback.
For the code to arrive, the Supabase email template must include the code: Authentication > Email Templates > **Magic Link**, add `{{ .Token }}` to the message (for example: `Your Kharcha Book code is {{ .Token }}`).
After the first sign-in the app offers to turn on the fingerprint / PIN lock, so later opens skip signing in.
